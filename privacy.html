        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 6, 2025</p>

        <p>The Memo ("we," "our," or "us") is a family communication device that enables parents and guardians to exchange messages with their children at home via SMS and voice. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users, especially children. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you create an account and set up your Memo device, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Parent/guardian name, email address, mobile phone number, and account credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Memo device ID, assigned phone number, and Wi-Fi connectivity status.</li>
            <li><strong>Message content:</strong> SMS messages sent by parents to the Memo device, and voice recordings made by children on the device that are transcribed to text.</li>
            <li><strong>Transcription data:</strong> Text transcriptions of children's voice messages, generated via third-party speech-to-text services.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent records:</strong> Timestamp, phone number, and IP address at the time of SMS opt-in consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely to provide and improve The Memo service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To deliver SMS messages between parents and the Memo device.</li>
            <li>To convert voice recordings to text transcriptions and send them to the parent's phone.</li>
            <li>To display incoming messages on the Memo device screen.</li>
            <li>To verify accounts and manage device registration.</li>
            <li>To provide customer support.</li>
            <li>To improve the reliability and performance of our service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Memo is designed for use by children ages 8–12 under parental supervision. We do not collect personal information directly from children. Children interact with The Memo device by recording voice messages, which are processed solely for the purpose of transcription and delivery to the parent's phone. Voice recordings are processed in real time and are not stored on our servers after transcription is complete.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate The Memo:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speech-to-text provider</strong> (e.g., OpenAI Whisper): To transcribe voice recordings into text. Audio data is transmitted securely and is not retained by the provider beyond processing.</li>
            <li><strong>SMS/telephony provider</strong> (e.g., Telnyx): To send and receive SMS messages on behalf of your Memo device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These providers process data only as necessary to perform their services and are bound by their own privacy policies and data protection obligations.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</strong> We only share data with the third-party service providers described above, as required to operate The Memo service, or as required by law.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Message content (SMS texts and transcriptions) is retained only as long as necessary to deliver messages and provide message history within the Memo device. Voice recordings are deleted immediately after transcription. Account information is retained for as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encrypted communications (TLS/SSL), secure API authentication, and access controls. While no system is completely secure, we take reasonable steps to protect the information you share with us.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate information.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data.</li>
            <li>Opt out of SMS messaging at any time by replying STOP to any message from your Memo device number.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by email or through the Memo device. Your continued use of the service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
