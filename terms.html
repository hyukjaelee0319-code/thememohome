        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 6, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Program Name &amp; Description</h2>
        <p><strong>The Memo</strong> is a family communication device and messaging service. Parents and guardians send SMS text messages to a dedicated phone number assigned to their Memo device at home. The device displays these messages and reads them aloud for children. Children can reply by recording voice messages on the device, which are transcribed to text and delivered back to the parent's mobile phone via SMS.</p>

        <h2>2. Consent to Receive Messages</h2>
        <p>By creating a Memo account and registering your mobile phone number during device setup at thememohome.com, you expressly consent to receive SMS messages from The Memo service at the phone number you provide. These messages include transcribed voice messages from your children, delivery confirmations, and service notifications related to your Memo device.</p>

        <h2>3. Message Frequency</h2>
        <p>Message frequency varies based on your family's usage of The Memo device. You will receive an SMS each time your child records and sends a voice message from the device, as well as occasional service notifications. There is no fixed number of messages per month — frequency depends entirely on how often your family uses the device.</p>

        <h2>4. Message &amp; Data Rates</h2>
        <p>Message and data rates may apply. Standard messaging rates from your mobile carrier apply to all SMS messages sent to and received from your Memo device number. The Memo is not responsible for any charges imposed by your wireless carrier.</p>

        <h2>5. Opt-Out Instructions</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>To stop receiving SMS messages from your Memo device at any time, reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message received from your Memo device number. You will receive a confirmation message and no further messages will be sent.</p>
            <p>You may also opt out by logging into your account at thememohome.com or by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1c6f696c6c736e685c6874797179717374737179327f7371"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="265553565649545266524e434b434b494e494b430845494b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
            <p>Please note that opting out of SMS will disable the messaging functionality between your phone and the Memo device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Help &amp; Support</h2>

        <h2>7. Eligible Users</h2>
        <p>The Memo account and SMS messaging service is available to parents and guardians who are 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States. The Memo device is designed for use by children ages 8–12 under parental supervision. Children do not need a phone number or mobile device to use The Memo.</p>

        <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use The Memo service only for its intended purpose: family communication between parents/guardians and their children. You agree not to use the service to send unsolicited messages, spam, or any content that is illegal, harmful, or abusive.</p>

        <h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>The Memo service requires a working Wi-Fi connection for the device and cellular service for the parent's mobile phone. We strive to provide reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Service may be affected by Wi-Fi outages, carrier disruptions, or scheduled maintenance.</p>

        <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Memo name, logo, device design, software, and all related materials are the intellectual property of The Memo and are protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from any of our materials without prior written consent.</p>

        <p>The Memo is provided "as is" and "as available." We are not liable for any delays, failures, or errors in message delivery, transcription accuracy, or device performance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, The Memo shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service.</p>

        <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of The Memo is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information. We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
